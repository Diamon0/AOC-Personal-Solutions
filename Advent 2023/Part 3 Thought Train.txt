Coordinate Grid

first pass:
Store Line and Range for the surrounding coordinates when you find a symbol

second pass:
store the found numbers, maybe in a hashmap to prevent duplicates


ALTERNATIVE:
Create the coordinate grid instead of treating it as one


ALTERNATIVE:
The string kind of already is a grid if you think about it hard enough


WILD THOUGHT:
Tic Tac Toe anyone?
